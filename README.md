# Artext
Artext is an in-development code editor.
Use ctrl+O to open files, ctrl+S to save, ctrl+alt+S to save as, and ctrl+N to make a new file.

- Make sure to keep the [languages](https://github.com/Youssef-Mag/artext/tree/master/languages) folder in your Artext directory (included in the zip).

Currently supports:
- Python
-  C#
-  JS 

But it's very easy to add custom support, just copy the format in [languages](https://github.com/Youssef-Mag/artext/tree/master/languages) and put it in said file.

built with html/css/js and [Neutralinojs](https://neutralino.js.org/).

# Full custom theme support coming soon
Currently you can fully customize the theme but you have to recompile Artext, check [styles.css](https://github.com/Youssef-Mag/artext/blob/master/resources/styles.css) and Neutralino's [getting started guide](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/getting-started/your-first-neutralinojs-app).
